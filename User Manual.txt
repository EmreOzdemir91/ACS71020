ACS71020 Class-
    Class has 6 Parameteres as follows :
        ACS71020_type type 
            It is user defined datatype. User should specify his/her version or model of ACS71020 
            For eg. ACS71020_30A , ACS71020_15A
        CS (Chip Select)
            Integer values is expected
            Define the pin you have selected for selecting slave
        mosi (Master Out Slave IN)
            Integer values is expected
            Define the pin number selected for mosi(SPI Communication)
        miso (Master In Slave Out)
            Integer values is expected
            Define the pin number selected for miso(SPI Communication)
        SCLK (Serial Clock Cycle)
            Integer values is expected
            Define the pin number selected for SCLK(SPI Communication)
        vmax (Maximum or Full Scale Voltage)
            Integer values is expected
            Define Maximum or Full Scale voltage user is supplying 
            For eg 230.00 , 240.00
    Making a object of class
        sensor = ACS71020(ACS71020_30A, 10, 11, 12, 13, 230.00)


Functions which can be used:-
    float getvalue(value_type);
        value_type is again user defined datatype where user can define which value user wants from sensor.
        Values are case sensitive.
        Returns Float value which is stored in register of ACS71020.
        For eg.
            irms,vrms,pactive,papparant,preactive,pfactor,numpstout,vcodes,icodes
    void setup();
        This function sets up the pinmodes of required pins.
